# 🧿 backtest-ollama-crontab

> A **TypeScript monorepo** for [backtest-kit](https://github.com/tripolskypetr/backtest-kit) demonstrating how a local **Ollama LLM** (running `gpt-oss` quantized) can be wired into a trading-signal pipeline as an **outline-based risk filter**, with a **15-minute crontab** doing live Telegram-channel ingestion. The strategy parses signals from any public Telegram channel, asks the LLM whether each signal is safe to trade

📚 **[API Reference](https://backtest-kit.github.io/documents/example_02_first_backtest.html)** | 🌟 **[Quick Start](https://github.com/tripolskypetr/backtest-kit/tree/master/example)**

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Build the workspace packages

```bash
npm run build:x        # macOS / Linux
npm run build:win      # Windows
```

Each build emits per-package `build/index.cjs` + rolled-up `types.d.ts`.

### 2. Authenticate the Telegram MTProto session

```bash
cd ./packages/main
npm run auth
```

A QR code prints in the terminal. Scan it with the Telegram app on your phone (Settings → Devices → Link Desktop Device). On success, a `session.txt` file is written next to the auth command.

### 3. Copy the session into the strategy folder

```bash
cp packages/main/session.txt content/jan_2026.strategy/session.txt
```

The strategy reads this file at runtime to subscribe to the configured channel without re-authenticating.

### 4. Run the backtest

From the repo root:

```bash
npm start -- --backtest --ui --entry ./content/jan_2026.strategy/jan_2026.strategy.ts
```

## 🎯 What this repo demonstrates

A real-world experiment: take any free, public Telegram trading-signals channel, wire each signal through a **local Ollama LLM** (`gpt-oss` quantized) acting as a risk filter, and measure whether the LLM gate actually improves P&L on historical data.

### Pipeline

1. **Telegram crawler** (`packages/core/src/lib/services/core/CrawlerService.ts`) — pulls raw messages from the configured channel.

2. **Parser** (`packages/core/src/lib/services/screen/ChannelScreenService.ts`) — extracts `direction`, `entry`, `targets`, `stoploss` from signal text into a `parser-items` Mongo collection.

3. **Risk outline** ([`packages/core/src/logic/outline/risk.outline.ts`](packages/core/src/logic/outline/risk.outline.ts)) — for every parsed signal, runs the LLM against 1m/15m candles + a pre-computed metrics packet (`avgRangePct`, `momentum24hPct`) and asks for a `riskAction: "skip" | "follow"` verdict.

4. **Strategy** ([`content/jan_2026.strategy/jan_2026.strategy.ts`](content/jan_2026.strategy/jan_2026.strategy.ts)) — opens a position only when the LLM voted `follow` and the live price falls inside the channel's entry zone. TP = `targets[2]`, SL = `signal.stoploss`.

5. **Crontab triggers** — `Cron.register` from `backtest-kit` schedules a `15m` live-fetch and a one-shot backtest-prepare handler. In live mode the worker re-polls the channel every 15 minutes; in backtest mode it pulls the entire frame at startup.

The LLM correctly **vetoed 6 signals**, of which **4 were losers** (`TRX SHORT Jan 06 −4.24%`, `NEAR LONG Jan 07 −4.26%`, `TRX SHORT Jan 12 −4.45%`, `SOL LONG Jan 28 −4.34%`) — totaling **−17.29% avoided**. The two skipped winners (`TRX SHORT Jan 22 +1.89%`, `TRX SHORT Jan 30 +0.58%`) cost **−2.47%**. **Net win: +14.82% from filtering**, plus one additional trade (`TRX LONG Jan 15 +1.86%`) the LLM run captured.

## 🛠️ Architecture in 60 seconds

| Layer | File | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| Crawl | `packages/core/src/lib/services/core/CrawlerService.ts` | Telegram `iterMessages` → `parser-items` upsert |
| Parse | `packages/core/src/lib/services/screen/ChannelScreenService.ts` | Regex extraction of `direction/entry/targets/stoploss` |
| Job | `packages/core/src/lib/services/job/SignalJobService.ts` | Subscribes to `signalJobSubject`, runs each unvisited row through `SignalLogicService` |
| Outline | `packages/core/src/logic/outline/risk.outline.ts` | LLM prompt + `commitMetricsHistory` + zod-validated response |
| Logic | `packages/core/src/lib/services/logic/SignalLogicService.ts` | Pure passthrough of LLM verdict to `screen-items` DTO |
| Schema | `packages/core/src/schema/Screen.schema.ts` | Final stored fields: `direction`, `entryFrom/To`, `targets`, `stoploss`, `riskAction`, `riskSureLevel`, `riskConfidence`, `riskDescription`, `riskReasoning` |
| Strategy | `content/jan_2026.strategy/jan_2026.strategy.ts` | Reads `screen-items`, opens position only when `riskAction === "follow"` |
| Cron | same file, `Cron.register(...)` | `interval: "15m"` for live polling; no `interval` = one-shot backtest prepare |

## 🔑 Environment Variables

| Var | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `CC_MONGO_CONNECTION_STRING` | `mongodb://localhost:27017/backtest-pro?wtimeoutMS=15000` | Mongo connection |
| `CC_TELEGRAM_API_ID` | `31861455` | Telegram MTProto API ID |
| `CC_TELEGRAM_API_HASH` | `ca60446c67ce250ee4e789c730163449` | Telegram MTProto API hash |
| `CC_SYMBOL_LIST` | `BTCUSDT,POLUSDT,ZECUSDT,HYPEUSDT,DOGEUSDT,SOLUSDT,PENGUUSDT,TRXUSDT,HBARUSDT,NEARUSDT,FARTCOINUSDT,ETHUSDT,PUMPUSDT,ENAUSDT` | Comma-separated symbols crawled per run |
| `CC_OLLAMA_URL` | `http://localhost:11434` | Ollama HTTP endpoint serving `gpt-oss` |

## 📜 Summary

| Aspect | This monorepo |
|---|---|
| **LLM gate** | Local Ollama (`gpt-oss` quantized) consulted per signal, returns `riskAction: "skip" \| "follow"` |
| **Empirical rules** | Embedded in LLM system prompt (`avgRangePct < 0.07%` for SHORT; `momentum24hPct < -1%` for LONG) — tunable without recompiling `packages/` |
| **Live ingestion** | 15-minute crontab via `Cron.register(.., interval: "15m")` polls the configured channel |
| **Backtest result** | January 2026: **+52.22% → +68.90%** with the LLM gate (Sharpe **+0.309 → +0.512**, winrate **68% → 82%**) |
| **DI surface** | `globalThis.core` typed via root `tsconfig.json` paths → rolled-up `types.d.ts` |
| **Strategy isolation** | Strategy files in `./content/` are loaded by `@backtest-kit/cli` at runtime, never bundled into `@pro/*` |
